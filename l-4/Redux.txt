Redux->it is a way to manage the states
    ->it has a centrelized storage made up of slices
    ->slices are the portions of data where states are present

To create a slice we have to give the ->name of the slice
                                      ->intial state of the slice
                                      -> reducer/functionality of the slice

to create a slice we have a inbuilt function -> createSlice()
